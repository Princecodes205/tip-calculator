## Overview

This is basically a tip calculator that help you claculate the tip value for a fix amount and also the amount of people involved.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

This Calculaor was build using html, css, and javascript.
This was quite an easy project for me tho the javascript was quite hard for me but I'll always get it done ðŸ˜Ž.

But then the app works in a way that only when the bill input has a value and when the number of people has a value thats when it does the calculation for tip per person and total bill per person.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Still nothing new just the same function calls ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž

### Continued development

Despite noting new I would love to continue building so as to improve my skills and also to pursue higher hights in the software engineering space
